# longurl

Expand Short ‘URLs’

## Description

Tools are provided to expand vectors of short URLs into long ‘URLs’. No
‘API’ services are used, which may mean that this operates more slowly
than ‘API’ services do (since they usually cache results of expansions
that every user of the service requests). You can setup your own caching
layer with the ‘memoise’ package if you wish to have a speedup during
single sessions or add larger dependencies, such as ‘Redis’, to gain a
longer-term performance boost at the expense of added complexity.

## What’s Inside The Tin

The following functions are implemented:

  - `expand_urls`: Expand a vector of (short) URLs using

## Installation

``` r
install.packages("longurl", repos = c("https://cinc.rud.is", "https://cloud.r-project.org/"))
# or
remotes::install_git("https://git.rud.is/hrbrmstr/longurl.git")
# or
remotes::install_git("https://git.sr.ht/~hrbrmstr/longurl")
# or
remotes::install_gitlab("hrbrmstr/longurl")
# or
remotes::install_github("hrbrmstr/longurl")
```

NOTE: To use the ‘remotes’ install options you will need to have the
[{remotes} package](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes) installed.

## Usage

``` r
library(longurl)
library(magrittr)

# current version
packageVersion("longurl")
## [1] '0.3.2'
```

``` r
c(

) -> test_urls

expand_urls(test_urls) %>% 
  dplyr::select(orig_url, status_code, expanded_url) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```
