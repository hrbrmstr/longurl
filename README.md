longurl : Expand Short URLs using the 'URL-Expander' API

This does a bit more than [decode\_short\_url](https://github.com/geoffjentry/twitteR/blob/master/R/utils.R#L22-L31) from the [twitteR](https://github.com/geoffjentry/twitteR) package since it:

-   has an option to do a post-expand check with a `HEAD` request to ensure the resource exists (useful when you think longurl just failed to expand)
-   has an option to warn on expansion issues
-   has an option for progress bars
-   works with a vector of URLs
-   returns `data_frame`s

The following functions are implemented:

-   `expand_urls`: Expand a vector of (short) URLs using the longurl service

The following data sets are included:
