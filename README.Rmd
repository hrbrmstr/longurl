longurl : Tools expand vectors of short URLs into long URLs.

This does a bit more than [decode_short_url](https://github.com/geoffjentry/twitteR/blob/master/R/utils.R#L22-L31) from the [twitteR](https://github.com/geoffjentry/twitteR) package since it:

- doesn't rely on a URL expansion API (anymore)
- has an option for progress bars
- works with a vector of URLs
- returns `tbl_df`s that include HTTP status code for final (expanded) URL

The following functions are implemented:

- `expand_urls`:	Expand a vector of (short) URLs

The following data sets are included:

### Installation
